                In my third week at Base Camp Coding Academy, we had an assignment to
                make a health depleting game using what we had learned so far in Python.
                The story behind this game is that you are dragged into your tv by a
                static humanoid and wake up in a forest clearing. In front of you there
                are three goblins and the static humanoid in a suit sitting on a throne
                behind the goblins. You have to fight the goblins and defeat the boss at
                the end of the level. What this project has taught me is to have
                confidence in my work and to keep working to achieve my goal to be video
                game developer.
