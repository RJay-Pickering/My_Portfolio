      When I was growing up, I lived in a farm with animals. In that farm, it
      was me and my dad, Rocky JR., working to keep the machines running and
      keeping the animals taken care of. From my life on the farm, I have
      learned how to manage livestock, how to work on automobiles, how to become
      a morning person, and how to become a hard worker and determined to never
      quit. I have also learned many things in my time in Highschool Vo-Tech. I
      learned how to work wires, to fix and use machineries, and know how to
      have a good time while getting work done as fast and great as you can.
      Lastly, Base Camp Coding Academy has taught me how to become a software
      engineer, how to act and what to do in interviews, and how to start
      conversations with everyone.
