        These are my first three websites that I have made using only HTML and
        CSS. Charity is about a charity for rebooting Black Ops for the newer
        gen consoles. Scrimba is a challenge website that I had to do for BCCA.
        The Portfolio website is about me and my skills. These first three
        projects taught me how to do Html and Css. This also taught me to make
        better Html projects.

        A classmate and I were partnered for a unit project to build something
        in Python. We discussed what we could do for our unit project and
        decided to make a Pokemon safari park game revolving around the third
        generation Pokemon's. You go and have random encounters with pokemon in
        the wild or you can go fight the gym leaders to obtain a Bronze, Silver,
        and Gold Metal. We also added a legendary that you can find and catch
        after obtaining the Golden Metal from the battle towers. From this
        project, I had learned how to have teamwork and help work on my
        communication with others.

        This is my first ever health depleting game that I had made using
        Python. In my third week at Base Camp Coding Academy, we had an
        assignment to make a health depleting game using what we had learned so
        far. The story behind this game is that you are dragged into your tv by
        a static humanoid and wake up in a forest clearing. In front of you is
        three goblins and the static humanoid in a suit sitting on a throne
        behind the goblins. You have to fight the goblins and defeat the boss at
        the end of the level. What this project has taught me is to have
        confidence in my work and to keep working to achieve my goal to be video
        game designer.
