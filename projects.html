      These are my first three websites that I have made using only HTML and
      CSS. Charity is about a charity for rebooting Black Ops for the newer gen
      consoles. Scrimba is a challenge website that I had to do for BCCA. The
      Portfolio website is about me and my skills. <br />

      Logan Coley and I were partnered for a unit project to build something in
      Python. We discussed what we could do for our unit project and decided to
      make a Pokemon game revolving around the third generation Pokemons. We
      even added a legendary that you can find after obtaining the golden metal.
      I recommend trying this project out and seeing our result!

      This is a photo of my 1968 Ford Ranger that my dad and I rebuilt. When we
      bought this truck around 2007, the truck was just a frame and most of the
      interior. We worked on this truck for a few years and put in a new engine,
      new transmission, basically new everything! The truck still runs
      amazingly. I think working on this project taught me how to work with
      others, how to restore old vehicles, and how to never give up on a
      difficult task.
