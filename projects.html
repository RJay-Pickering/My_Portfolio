      My first three websites that I have made using only HTML and CSS. Charity
      is about a Charity for rebooting Black Ops for the newer gen consoles.
      Scrimba is a challenge website that I had to do for BCCA. The Portfolio
      website is about me and my skills. <br />

      Me and Logan Coley was partnered for a unit project to build something in
      Python. We discussed about what we could do for our unit project and
      decided to make a Pokemon game revolved around the third generation
      Pokemon's. We rushed it to make it finished by the deadline. It works and
      is still good though. I still recommending trying it out and seeing our
      result!
