      These are my first three websites that I have made using only HTML and
      CSS. Charity is about a charity for rebooting Black Ops for the newer gen
      consoles. Scrimba is a challenge website that I had to do for BCCA. The
      Portfolio website is about me and my skills. <br />

      A CLassmate and I were partnered for a unit project to build something in
      Python. We discussed what we could do for our unit project and decided to
      make a Pokemon game revolving around the third generation Pokemons. We
      even added a legendary that you can find after obtaining the golden metal.
      I recommend trying this project out and seeing our result!
