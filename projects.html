        These are my first three websites that I have made using only HTML and
        CSS. Charity is about a campaign to reboot Black Ops for the newer gen
        consoles. Scrimba is a challenge website that taught me a lot about
        margin and padding that I had to do for BCCA. The Portfolio website is
        about me and my skills. These first three projects taught me how to do
        HTML and CSS. This also taught me to make better HTML projects.

        A classmate and I were partnered for a unit project to build something
        in Python. We decided to make a Pokemon safari park game revolving
        around the third generation Pokemons. The player has random encounters
        with Pokemon in the wild or can go fight the gym leaders to obtain a
        Bronze, Silver, and Gold Medal. We also added a Legendary that you can
        find and catch after obtaining the Golden Medal from the battle towers.
        From this project, I learned teamwork and worked on my communication
        skills.

        In my third week at Base Camp Coding Academy, we had an assignment to
        make a health depleting game using what we had learned so far in Python.
        The story behind this game is that you are dragged into your tv by a
        static humanoid and wake up in a forest clearing. In front of you there
        are three goblins and the static humanoid in a suit sitting on a throne
        behind the goblins. You have to fight the goblins and defeat the boss at
        the end of the level. What this project has taught me is to have
        confidence in my work and to keep working to achieve my goal to be video
        game designer.

        While I was working with my Industry Mentor, Ana Filote, she started to
        teach me how to make video games using Pygame. She has taught me how to
        make the Snake Game(BETA), and the Pong-Game(Needs Work). Over the
        Course of the time, I was finally able to teach her how to make my own
        kind of game. -that game is not in github right now!

        This is my first Django project that I had made in my time at Base Camp.
        This project is called Missing Cats Of America, a website for posting or
        finding missing cats. You can add your missing cats and see others
        missing cats to see if you have seen them. I made this website because
        during the time of learning Django, my cat went missing. I made this
        website for my cat.

        This project is my first big project to write in JavaScript. Another 
        classmate worked with me in coming up with and designing a first ever 
        chatbot for Base Camp Coding Academy named Everest. This bot took two 
        days to build, but is already in its beta form. The only thing it has 
        as of now, is only certain questions about BCCA that are asked all the 
        time, as told by our director. We plan on continuing this program and 
        making it better for the users and making it for a certain school or a 
        company one day.
