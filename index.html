      <p class="paragraph">
        Welcome to my website! I am a graduate at South Pontotoc High School and
        currently a student at Base Camp Coding Academy in Water Valley, MS. I
        also work at my farmland, Pickering Hereford Hogs, where we sell
        Hereford Hogs and tend to the other animals like the cows and the dogs.
        My hobbies include playing video games, working on machines (like
        trucks, tractors, electric tools, etc.), and writing short stories. When
        I started at Base Camp, I had no coding experience, but I was determined
        to learn. What got me determined to learn coding is my PlayStation. When
        I was eight, I got my first console and I always played on it as a way
        to relax and have fun. I have made so many great memories from that
        game, and I would like to make games that others would enjoy as well.
