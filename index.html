    <h1 class="textmain">Reboot Black Ops Charity</h1>
    <h3 class="text">About Charity</h3>
    <p class="learning">
      This Charity is about making Call of Duty Black Ops available for the
      newest consoles. The Reboot will not change anything about the game, but
      maybe the FPS and the random glitches in the game.
    </p>
    <h3 class="text">How we will do this?</h3>
    <p class="learning">
      With your donation, we will pay Treyarch and Activision to either remake
      the game onto the newer consoles or by all rights of Black Ops. We will
      ensure that nothing will be changed but the glitches and Frames will be
      fixed and better than ever.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text">What about the Zombies Mode?</h3>
    <p class="learning">
      Zombies will of course stay the same! The DLC maps will also stay the
      same!
    </p>
    <h3 class="text">How much is asked?</h3>
    <p class="learning">
      We would need at least $18-28 million dollars. I know I am asking a lot,
      but think about it! Your favorite game that is the same as it use to be
      but it will run smoother and be available for your newest console! you
      could show your children the game that you grew up playing! Show them the
      two chads that made you the man that you are today!
