# **MY PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW**

My portfolio is about me and the skill that i have learned over the years of programming.  All of my projects are also there, to be seen in action or the code of the project (depending on the language they are in).

### Updates on this repository!

1. The folder labeled "original-portfolio" is what the project was originally looked liked before i started from scratch to remake it!
    - Why make a new portfolio? It seems like it could be better than it is now.
    - Why is the old portfolio in a folder with the new portfolio? thats because I wanted to keep my old portfolio at the same time, have my new portfolio be the main thing that people see!

2. The folder labeled "testing-new-web" is what the new portfolio will be in while i build the new website. When im satisfied with the new portfolio, i will delete this folder putting it as the main webpage they see when they go into my page!
