# **MY PORTFOLIO OVERVIEW**


## This text file will explain some confusions on this repository.
1: The folder labeled "original-portfolio" is what the project was originally looked liked before i started from scratch to remake it!
    1.1: Why make a new portfolio? It seems like it could be better than it is now.
    1.2: Why is the old portfolio in a folder with the new portfolio? thats because I wanted to keep my old portfolio at the same time, have my new portfolio be the main thing that people see!
2: The folder labeled "testing-new-web" is what the new portfolio will be in while i build the new website. When im satisfied with the new portfolio, i will delete this folder putting it as the main webpage they see when they go into my page!
